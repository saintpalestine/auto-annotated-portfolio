      ## My name is Saint, and I’m fully committed to the philosophy of lifelong
      learning. As a creative computer science student, I’m passionate about
      problem-solving, design, web development, and making music. The unique
      blend of creativity, logic, and technology fuels my excitement for coding,
      especially as I explore Python, JavaScript, and building dynamic
      applications. Constantly striving to learn and refine my skills, I’m
      driven by curiosity and the desire to create.


      #### **When I’m not coding, I dive into music production, explore design,
      and pay attention to the details that make every creative project stand
      out. Follow my journey on Instagram: @saintchromasalvitore.**
